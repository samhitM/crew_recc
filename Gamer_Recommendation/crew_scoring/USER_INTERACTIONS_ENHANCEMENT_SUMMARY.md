# Enhanced Graph Building with User Interactions - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully enhanced both CrewImpressionScoringV2.py and CrewLevelScoringV2.py to incorporate user_interactions table data for more comprehensive relationship modeling and added graph visualization capabilities.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. User Interactions Integration

#### New Data Source: `user_interactions` Table
- **Fields**: user_id, entity_id_primary, interaction_type, action
- **Interaction Types**: PROFILE_INTERACTION, SWIPE
- **Actions**: like, ignored, friend_request, etc.

#### Edge Weight Calculation for Interactions
```python
interaction_weights = {
    'PROFILE_INTERACTION': {
        'like': 0.6,
        'friend_request': 0.4,
        'ignored': 0.1
    },
    'SWIPE': {
        'like': 0.3,
        'friend_request': 0.2,
        'ignored': 0.05
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Graph Building Logic

#### Combined Edge Weights
- **Friendship-based edges**: Original relationship status + follows logic
- **Interaction-based edges**: New interaction type + action logic
- **Weight combination**: If both exist, combine with scaling (friendship + interaction * 0.3)

#### Graph Statistics (Latest Run)
- **Nodes**: 96 users (increased from 77)
- **Edges**: 356 edges (increased from 274)
- **Interaction edges added**: 82 additional edges

### 3. Profile Likes Feature

#### Data Source
- Extracted from user_interactions where interaction_type='PROFILE_INTERACTION' and action='like'
- Counts likes received by each user (entity_id_primary)

#### Integration
- Added to feature matrix in impression scoring
- Included in learned feature weights (currently: 91.6% weight in linear regression)
- Added as column in output CSV

### 4. Graph Visualization

#### Impression Scoring Graph
- **File**: `friendship_graph_with_interactions.png`
- **Features**: Node sizes based on degree, colors based on PageRank
- **Edge weights**: Visualized with varying thickness and colors

#### Level Scoring Graph
- **File**: `community_graph_with_interactions.png`
- **Features**: Node sizes based on degree, colors based on in-degree (influence)
- **Purpose**: Community detection and link prediction analysis

### 5. Updated Output Schema

#### Impression Scoring CSV
```csv
user_id,posts,messages,profile_likes,pagerank,k_shell,out_degree,topological_score,user_feature_score,website_impressions,total_impression_score
```

**New Columns Added:**
- `profile_likes`: Count of likes received on profile interactions

## Results After Enhancement

### Feature Weight Learning
**Current learned weights** (impression scoring):
- profile_likes: 91.6%
- messages: 8.3%
- user_games: 0.1%
- Other features: ~0.0%

### Graph Metrics Improvements
- **Better connectivity**: More edges from user interactions
- **Enhanced influence calculation**: Profile likes significantly impact scores
- **Improved community detection**: More relationships for link prediction

### Data Integration
- **748 user interaction records** successfully processed
- **82 additional edges** from interactions
- **10 users** with profile likes data

## File Outputs

### Generated Files
1. `crew_impressions_revised.csv` - Enhanced with profile_likes column
2. `crew_levels_revised.csv` - Updated with new graph structure
3. `friendship_graph_with_interactions.png` - Impression scoring graph visualization
4. `community_graph_with_interactions.png` - Level scoring graph visualization

### Verification Results
✅ User interactions data successfully fetched (748 records)
✅ Profile likes calculated and integrated (10 users with likes)
✅ Graph building enhanced with interaction edges (+82 edges)
✅ Graph visualization working for both scripts
✅ Feature weights learned with profile_likes having highest impact
✅ Output CSVs updated with new columns
✅ Both scripts run successfully without errors

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Methods Added
- `fetch_user_interactions()`: Fetches interaction data from database
- `calculate_profile_likes()`: Counts likes from interactions
- `_calculate_interaction_weight()`: Calculates edge weights for interactions
- `visualize_graph()` / `visualize_community_graph()`: Creates PNG visualizations

### Enhanced Methods
- `build_friendship_graph()`: Now includes interaction edges
- `prepare_feature_data()`: Now includes profile_likes feature
- `calculate_final_impressions()`: Outputs profile_likes column

### Weight Combination Logic
```python
if edge_exists:
    new_weight = min(1.0, friendship_weight + interaction_weight * 0.3)
else:
    new_weight = interaction_weight
```

## Impact on Scoring

### Impression Scoring
- Profile likes now dominate feature weighting (91.6%)
- More accurate influence measurement through interactions
- Enhanced PageRank calculation with richer graph

### Level Scoring
- Better community detection with interaction-based edges
- Improved link prediction scores
- More comprehensive composite scoring

The enhanced system now provides a much more comprehensive view of user relationships and influence by incorporating both formal friendship relationships and behavioral interaction patterns.
