# Graph Building Logic Verification

## Corrected Implementation Summary

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Proper JSON Structure Parsing**:
   - **Before**: Treated outer key as user ID
   - **After**: Skip outer key, extract actual user IDs from inner objects

2. **Correct Edge Weight Calculation**:
   - Status weights: friends/accepted=1.0, pending=0.5, others=0.1
   - Follow boost: +0.4 (changed from +0.3)
   - Edge direction: From each user to other users based on their individual status

3. **Bidirectional Relationship Handling**:
   - Each user gets edges based on their own status toward other users
   - Correctly handles asymmetric relationships

### Example JSON Processing:

**Input JSON:**
```json
{
  "3oYkVCJVJEH_8PzI8nEQu5L": {
    "3oYkVCJVJEH": {"status": "friends", "follows": false},
    "8PzI8nEQu5L": {"status": "friends", "follows": false}
  }
}
```

**Graph Edges Created:**
- `3oYkVCJVJEH` → `8PzI8nEQu5L` (weight = 1.0, status="friends")
- `8PzI8nEQu5L` → `3oYkVCJVJEH` (weight = 1.0, status="friends")

### Results Comparison:

**Before Correction:**
- Graph: 215 nodes, 275 edges
- Many edges using outer keys as source nodes (incorrect)

**After Correction:**
- Graph: 77 nodes, 274 edges
- All edges use actual user IDs (correct)
- More accurate PageRank and influence calculations

### Edge Weight Examples:

| Status | Follows | Weight | Calculation |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| friends | false | 1.0 | 1.0 + 0.0 |
| friends | true | 1.0 | 1.0 + 0.4 (capped at 1.0) |
| accepted | false | 1.0 | 1.0 + 0.0 |
| accepted | true | 1.0 | 1.0 + 0.4 (capped at 1.0) |
| pending | false | 0.5 | 0.5 + 0.0 |
| pending | true | 0.9 | 0.5 + 0.4 |
| blocked | false | 0.1 | 0.1 + 0.0 |
| blocked | true | 0.5 | 0.1 + 0.4 |

### Verification Results:

✅ **Graph Structure**: Correctly identifies user IDs from JSON
✅ **Edge Weights**: Properly calculated based on status + follows
✅ **PageRank**: Now uses actual user relationships
✅ **Node Count**: Reduced from 215 to 77 (more accurate)
✅ **Integration**: Level scoring correctly uses impression scores

### Impact on Metrics:

- **PageRank**: More accurate influence scores
- **K-Shell**: Better community core identification  
- **Out-Degree**: Correct weighted connection counts
- **Community Detection**: Improved with proper relationships
- **Level Assignment**: More accurate composite scores

The corrected implementation now properly parses the JSON relationship structure and creates meaningful directed weighted graphs that accurately represent user relationships and influence patterns.
